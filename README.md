## About
Wages gives you the dollar amount a person would make based on an hourly or annual rate. For example, if you are interested in how much money a year 25/hr amounts to, click on the hourly radio button and input 25 into the text box. The calculator used for this application makes __two assumptions__. A person will work __40__ hours a week, for __52__ weeks. The application is hosted on Surge.sh at [Wages](http://wages.surge.sh)

## Roadmap(maybe)
- [ ] Give users the ability to change work assumptions
- [ ] Other currency symbols
- [ ] Implement a service worker for offline use
